# Overall Challenge

The overall challenge is a gift card that the first user to get all Ports will receive. Each port contains a secret string from [keys.json](keys.json) that will be concatenated and hashed to get the [password](password). Both are generated by the [generate_keys.py](generate_keys.py) script.

The key can be rebuilt with the [rebuild_key.py](rebuild_key.py) script with all tokens in a file separate by newlines.
