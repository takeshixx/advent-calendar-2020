# Red Star

A JPG image with a Red Star OS watermark that includes the flag.

## Description

Should include hint for JPG file ending, DPRK, Red Star OS and maybe some redstar-tools.

```html
Santa receives Christmas greetings from all over the world. He also reads a lot of blogs about food and, of course, Christmas time. This year he also received greetings from a strange and isolated part of the world, with different standards. A world so strange that JPGs don't end with 0xFFD9... Santa was told there might be hidden secrets in that blog, but who would do something so strange?

Secret sources found out that pictures may include strange bits that are hidden to the casual users. But maybe with the right <a href="https://github.com/takeshixx/redstar-tools">tools</a> you might be able to uncover secrets for Santa?
